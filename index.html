            <p>
              <b>PVP style: </b> Small gang PVP (~10) to medium sized fleet PVP (50+).
              <br />
              <b>FCs: </b> Skirmish: Jackaryas, various small gang FCs
              <br />
              <b>Blue count: </b> ~6,000
              <br />
              <b>Active PVP pilots: </b> 69
              <br />
              <b>Members: </b> 278
              <br />
              <b>Hunting grounds: </b>0.0/Low Sec: Cloud Ring, Outer Ring, Syndicate, Black Rise, Fade, Fountain, Pure Blind
              <br />
              <b>Moon policy: </b> Corporation owned
              <br />

              <br />

              <br />
              <b>Interviewer's notes: </b> Suddenly Spaceships seems to have a lot of promise. They appear to be in a bit of a lull state without FCs available to take charge, but there is a lot of potential to
              lead from the front with CYN0. Half of Suddenly Spaceships blues are in the Drone regions for a PVE agreement. Suddenly Spaceships allows its corporations to station and deploy where they wish. Moons are corporation-controlled.

            <b>Interviewer's notes: </b> Mordus Angels are gravitating toward much larger operations. They are going to be encouraging
            members to utilize capitals. Moons are alliance-controlled and corporations are only authorized to own <i>some</i> R32s
            based on PVP participation.

            <b>Interviewer's notes: </b> FATE recently reformed in January 2017 and have made incredible progress in terms of organization and efficiency during that short time. They are the most up start
            of the alliances interviewed so far, but are primarily low sec based. Joining them will require an adjustment to playstyle, but offers significant rewards/potential. Moons are corporation-controlled.
